   Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function by iteratively moving towards the steepest descent.

7. **Differentiate hard and soft clustering:**  
   Hard clustering assigns each data point to a single cluster, while soft clustering assigns data points to multiple clusters with probabilities.

8. **Use of Independent component analysis:**  
   Used to separate a multivariate signal into additive, independent components.
